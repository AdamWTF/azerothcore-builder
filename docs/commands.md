# Commands

This page lists the implemented `bin/acore-manager` commands. It also lists integration helper scripts that are not exposed through the wrapper.

Risk levels:

- Read-only: should not change the system.
- Safe: writes backups, checks, or local artifacts without touching running services.
- Disruptive: starts/stops services, switches releases, or runs long builds.
- Destructive: deletes or prunes data. No destructive command is currently exposed by `bin/acore-manager`.

## OliveTin And Integrations

These scripts are optional and are not required for core server management.

| Script | Purpose | Needs sudo? | Risk | Example |

## Troubleshooting Gaps

Useful commands that are not currently implemented:

- `install-services`: bootstrap installs service templates, but there is no separate wrapper command just for service installation.
- `check-db` / `backup-db`: use the implemented `db-check` and `db-backup` command names.
